# Financial-Data-Validator
Data Validation tool to provide accurate financial data to end users

#Scenario 1: Early Detection of Data Anomalies in Budget Forecasting
Context:
A financial analyst at a large retail company is preparing quarterly budget forecasts using data ingested from various departments, including sales, operations, and HR. The data goes through multiple transformation steps before being fed into the AI/ML models used for scenario planning.

Problem:
During the last quarter’s forecast, undetected errors in the HR data (e.g., missing employee headcount in a department) caused a significant discrepancy in the company’s overall personnel cost projection, leading to inaccurate budget allocations.

How the Validator Helps:
The Financial Data Validator automatically scans the data at every transformation step, identifying missing or anomalous values (like missing headcount data). The tool generates an alert with a suggested correction based on historical data trends, allowing the analyst to fix the issue before it impacts the forecast.

Outcome:

Improved forecast accuracy by early detection of discrepancies.
Increased confidence in the budgeting process across departments.
Reduced manual effort in cross-verifying data sources.

#Scenario 2: Validation of Intermediate Calculations in Financial Reporting
Context:
A tech manager is responsible for overseeing the data pipeline that consolidates sales revenue from multiple regions and calculates total revenue for quarterly financial reporting. The pipeline includes several intermediate calculations (e.g., currency conversions, regional aggregations).

Problem:
In a previous quarter, a currency conversion issue went unnoticed, resulting in a significant error in the consolidated revenue figures. This error wasn’t caught until late in the reporting process, causing delays and additional workload to correct the reports.

How the Validator Helps:
The Validator continuously checks intermediate calculations at each stage of the pipeline. It detects that the currency conversion rate for one region is significantly off from historical averages and flags the issue for review. The tech manager receives a real-time alert with the discrepancy highlighted and a suggested correction.

Outcome:

Reduced risk of incorrect financial reporting.
Faster identification and resolution of data issues.
Increased trust in automated data pipelines, leading to streamlined reporting processes.

#Scenario 3: Ensuring Consistency Across Multiple Data Sources
Context:
A product manager overseeing the company’s planning tool notices inconsistent profit margin calculations in store-level reports compared to corporate-level reports. The data is sourced from multiple systems, including ERP, CRM, and inventory management systems.

Problem:
Discrepancies between these reports have led to confusion and mistrust among senior stakeholders, requiring time-consuming manual investigations by various teams to reconcile the data.

How the Validator Helps:
The Financial Data Validator cross-references data from all sources in real-time, ensuring that key metrics like profit margins are consistently calculated across different systems. When discrepancies arise, the Validator highlights the specific data points causing the inconsistency and suggests corrective actions based on historical trends.

Outcome:

Faster resolution of data discrepancies.
Enhanced trust in reports across different organizational levels.
Reduced time spent on manual reconciliation, improving overall efficiency.
