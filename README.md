# Financial-Data-Validator
Data Validation tool to provide accurate financial data to end users


# Purpose and Vision statement:
The Financial Data Validator aims to empower financial teams in a retail environment with confidence in the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of their planning and budgeting data. By leveraging generative AI to perform thorough validations across data ingestion pipelines, intermediate calculations, and final outputs, the tool provides early detection of discrepancies, enabling users to address issues before they impact critical business decisions.

# This solution will:

# Granularity and Dimensional Analysis:
Users can explore data across multiple dimensions (e.g., month, department, sales channel, location) and download or view data at the required level of granularity. This flexibility helps users observe and analyze data in the most relevant context for their decision-making.

# Anomaly Detection with Root Cause Identification:
When anomalies or discrepancies are detected, the Validator highlights the specific dimension or data point where the issue occurred. Whether it’s a problem with input data or intermediate calculations, users can quickly identify and trace the issue back to its origin, ensuring timely resolution.

# Accurate Forecasting and Enhanced User Confidence:
Product Managers, Tech Managers, Engineers, and Financial Analysts can trust that validated data feeds their AI/ML models for scenario planning. This reduces manual intervention and increases confidence across all stakeholders in the reliability of automated processes.

# Improved Operational Efficiency and Business Risk Mitigation:
By automating validation tasks and providing early and precise identification of data issues, the tool minimizes downstream impacts on forecasting, budgeting, and reporting. This reduces the risk of financial errors, delays, and missed business opportunities, while freeing up resources for higher-value tasks.



# Scenario 1: Early Detection of Data Anomalies in Budget Forecasting
Context:
A financial analyst at a large retail company is preparing quarterly budget forecasts using data ingested from various departments, including sales, operations, and HR. The data goes through multiple transformation steps before being fed into the AI/ML models used for scenario planning.

Problem:
During the last quarter’s forecast, undetected errors in the HR data (e.g., missing employee headcount in a department) caused a significant discrepancy in the company’s overall personnel cost projection, leading to inaccurate budget allocations.

How the Validator Helps:
The Financial Data Validator automatically scans the data at every transformation step, identifying missing or anomalous values (like missing headcount data). The tool generates an alert with a suggested correction based on historical data trends, allowing the analyst to fix the issue before it impacts the forecast.

Outcome:

Improved forecast accuracy by early detection of discrepancies.
Increased confidence in the budgeting process across departments.
Reduced manual effort in cross-verifying data sources.

# Scenario 2: Validation of Intermediate Calculations in Financial Reporting
Context:
A tech manager is responsible for overseeing the data pipeline that consolidates sales revenue from multiple regions and calculates total revenue for quarterly financial reporting. The pipeline includes several intermediate calculations (e.g., currency conversions, regional aggregations).

Problem:
In a previous quarter, a currency conversion issue went unnoticed, resulting in a significant error in the consolidated revenue figures. This error wasn’t caught until late in the reporting process, causing delays and additional workload to correct the reports.

How the Validator Helps:
The Validator continuously checks intermediate calculations at each stage of the pipeline. It detects that the currency conversion rate for one region is significantly off from historical averages and flags the issue for review. The tech manager receives a real-time alert with the discrepancy highlighted and a suggested correction.

Outcome:

Reduced risk of incorrect financial reporting.
Faster identification and resolution of data issues.
Increased trust in automated data pipelines, leading to streamlined reporting processes.

# Scenario 3: Ensuring Consistency Across Multiple Data Sources
Context:
A product manager overseeing the company’s planning tool notices inconsistent profit margin calculations in store-level reports compared to corporate-level reports. The data is sourced from multiple systems, including ERP, CRM, and inventory management systems.

Problem:
Discrepancies between these reports have led to confusion and mistrust among senior stakeholders, requiring time-consuming manual investigations by various teams to reconcile the data.

How the Validator Helps:
The Financial Data Validator cross-references data from all sources in real-time, ensuring that key metrics like profit margins are consistently calculated across different systems. When discrepancies arise, the Validator highlights the specific data points causing the inconsistency and suggests corrective actions based on historical trends.

Outcome:

Faster resolution of data discrepancies.
Enhanced trust in reports across different organizational levels.
Reduced time spent on manual reconciliation, improving overall efficiency.

# Scenario 4: Granularity and Dimensional Analysis
Context:
A financial analyst at a large retail company is preparing a quarterly sales performance report. The data is sourced from multiple departments and systems, covering various dimensions such as time (month, quarter), department (electronics, clothing), sales channel (online, in-store), and location (region, store). The AI/ML models rely on this data for scenario planning to project future sales performance.

Problem:
During a routine analysis, the analyst notices that the total revenue figures for the online channel in one region are unusually low compared to historical trends. The issue needs to be investigated at a granular level across various dimensions to identify whether it’s a data ingestion error, a transformation error, or a discrepancy in the input data.

How the Validator Helps:

The analyst uses the Granularity and Dimensional Analysis feature to drill down into the data by month, region, and sales channel.
The Validator highlights discrepancies at the region-month level, showing that the online sales data for a particular store in that region was missing.
The tool identifies the source of the issue: a misconfiguration in the data pipeline that failed to capture data from that store.
The Validator provides a suggested correction based on previous month trends for that store, allowing the analyst to quickly fix the issue and rerun the model.
Outcome:

The analyst identifies and corrects the error without manual cross-checks, saving significant time.
The corrected data ensures the accuracy of the sales forecast, leading to better-informed decision-making.
The automated detection and correction build trust in the system’s reliability, reducing future manual validation efforts.
